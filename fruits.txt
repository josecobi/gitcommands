git init - turns a folder into a git repo
git status - checks the status of the work we've done inside of the folder
git add <filename> - Used to stage work from the work area to the staging area
git commit -m "Type your Message" - creates history of our work

========================================================================

git branch - This allows us to list all of our branches (The current branch is marked with an asterisk)
git branch <branch_name> - This allows us to create new branches in our repository
git switch <branch_name> - This allows us to move to another branch
git merge <name of the branch you wish to merge to the main branch>
git branch -m <current_name> <new_name> - This allows us to change a branch name
git reset --hard HEAD~1 -  Undo the last commit

=============================================================

git remote -v - shows your remote configuration. If you don't see anything, that means you are not connected to any repository in the cloud. So create one in GitHub (or other similar platform), 
after creating it, the next screen shows the instructions to connect your local Git repository with your Github repository in the cloud:
    -   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your GitHub username/<yourNewGitHubRepository.git>
    -   git remote -v - to verify the code above worked
    -   git branch -M main - When you use this command, you are effectively renaming the branch you are currently on to the new name specified.
    ALWAYS CHECK IN FIRST WHICH BRANCH YOU ARE AT AND MAKE SURE TO CHECK IF IT IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE RENAMED.
    -   git push -u origin main
